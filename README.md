# Competences

There's several hard skills which I want to prove I have in this challenge:

  

-  #### NodeJS/React Stack

  

This program is made using NodeJS in the back-end and React in front-end.

  

**I have already done other servers** for games in my many years of experience in full-stack development using many frameworks in my company (Gunbound GITZ) and this challenge allowed me to show a good understanding about how software works.

  

-  #### Sessions

  

I made my own server-side sessions implementation, which was inspired by the same solution I made in other projects.

  

This solution stores a session cookie in the database and browser and uses it as authentication. It's implemented in a way that allows further control of sessions for the user, storing in the database information about the session such as IP, browser, and OS. This approach allows the creation of a page where the user can see all sessions and remove specific sessions. Similar to what is done in modern apps such as Facebook and others.

  

-  #### Understanding of Cybersecurity for any software

  

I want to show in this challenge that I have a good understanding about security-related practices while building a full stack app because I used to exploit them in order to make gamehacking when I was young. Since a very young age, I was a cheater(in online games) and this helped me to have a decent knowledge about which verifications must be in backend and which should'nt.

  

For online games, the choose of which verification should be on front or back-end is a very important skill in order to create a secure app (the best security is the code). That's a knowledge that is true to any software (not only games) and that's the competence I want to show here: I'm capable of see when the software have inconsistent checks on frontend and when the backend should'nt trust the client.

  

-  #### Fluent english writing/reading skills

  

I have years of experience working with multicultural teams in asynchronous chats.

The main language of the challenge is english-only to show my experience on creating software and documentations in english language so anyone can contribute and do maintenance.

  
  

-  #### Automated test coverage and Test-driven development

  

I am **already used to think alot before writing any code**.

This program was made using TDD/BDD/DDD methodology and I used Jest to create the tests.

  

-  #### High level of adaptability and very fast learning curve

  

I'm used to adapt myself.

This solution is a complete solution to show my high level of adaptability and very fast learning curve. **I accomplished every single topic of the challenge to prove that I can learn fast in order to deliver a project.** I've done this many times in my company, and like any entrepreneur I had to learn alot very fast.

  

-  #### SQL (PostgreSQL)

  

As mentioned in the challenge rules, we use postgreSQL for database.

I have more than 10 years of experience working with SQL in many databases(mySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc).

  

-  #### Software design patterns (MVC, SOLID, etc)

-  #### Conventional commits
