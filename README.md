## Competences
There's several hard skills which I want to prove I have in this challenge:

#### NodeJS /React

This program is made using NodeJS in the back-end and React in front-end.

I have many years of experience in full-stack development using many frameworks in my company (Gunbound GITZ) and this challenge allowed me to show a deep understanding about how software works.

#### Sessions

I made my own server-side sessions implementation, which is inspired by the same solution I made in another projects.

This solution store a session cookie in database and browser and use it as authentication. It's implemented in a way that allows to create a further control of sessions for the user, similar to what is done in modern apps such as Facebook and others.

#### Basic understanding of Cybersecurity for any software

I want to show in this challenge that I have a good understanding about security-related practices while building a full stack app because I used to exploit them in order to make gamehacking when I was young. Since a very young age, I was a cheater(in online games) and this helped me to have a decent knowledge about which verifications must be in backend and which should'nt.

For online games, the choose of which verification should be on front or back-end is a very important skill in order to create a secure app (the best security is the code). That's a knowledge that is true to any software (not only games) and that's the competence I want to show here: I'm capable of see when the software have inconsistent checks on frontend and when the backend should'nt trust the client.

#### Fluent english writing/reading skills

I have years of experience working with teams in asynchronous chats.
The main language of the challenge is english-only to show my experience on creating software and documentations in english language so anyone can contribute and do maintenance.


#### Automated test coverage and Test-driven Development

This program was made using TDD methodology and I used Jest to create the tests. 


#### PostgreSQL and using database from a nodeJS server

As mentioned in the challenge rules, we use postgreSQL for database.
